## 1. Project Overview

This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based room classification system for room type images. Using both custom Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and pretrained models, this project explores various techniques to optimize accuracy and minimize overfitting.

## 2. Dataset

The project uses two datasets:
- **Small Dataset**: Initially used for training and evaluation (5,192 images).
- **Large Dataset**: Larger and more balanced (130,995 images).

## 3. Models and Architectures

- **Simple CNN Model**: A lightweight CNN model for quick experimentation.
- **Complex CNN Model**: A deeper custom CNN with additional layers and regularization.  
- **Pretrained Models**: MobileNetV2 and ResNet50.
